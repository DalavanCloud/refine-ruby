# Ruby client library for Google Refine

This allows you to script Refine by creating projects from data files, applying extracted JSON operation histories against the data and then exporting the transformed data back out of Refine.

Work in progress! More docs soon

This will eventually be a gem

If you want to port this to another language, check out the [Refine API](https://github.com/maxogden/refine-python/wiki/Refine-API) documentation.
